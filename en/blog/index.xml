      <description>At the end of my three-week vacation, I was asked for a seemingly easy task. We were going to release the new version of the project we developed:
 Is today is the last working of the week? No. Is there any problem with the unit tests? No. Are all changes confirmed by the product manager, in the staging server? Yes.  I always note everything, and so I write this article to remind this experience.</description>

      <description>Environment Variables I still use some development tools that are used by most Linux users and these tools need some environment variables like LC_ALL, HOME, etc. When I have a new PC with Windows 10, I start to use with defining these variables. Take a look at this post for more detail.
PowerShell Core It&amp;rsquo;s possible to use BASH on Windows indeed, but I think PowerShell Core is a good alternative.</description>

      <description>For good things in life, you need labour, patience, and time.
 To draw a picture, To play an instrument, To program software, Or to produce something, Even to complete a book, To translate a text, To tell the troubles, To write what you think, To prepare a broadcast, For everything.  Just sharing something in social media and consuming it is easy.</description>

      <description> Our technology is not so advanced to be an eye or an ear for us.
Or we&amp;rsquo;re not in an age where we don&amp;rsquo;t need our body yet.

      <title>String quotes in PEP8</title>
      <link>https://gokmengorgen.net/en/blog/string-quotes-in-pep8/</link>

      <guid>https://gokmengorgen.net/en/blog/string-quotes-in-pep8/</guid>
      <description>I use PEP8 in my Python projects except for a few rules.
I think &amp;lsquo;single-quote&amp;rsquo; and &amp;ldquo;double-quote&amp;rdquo; characters should NOT be the same. It could be better if these two characters had different counterparts in the Python language parser system. So we could use one of them for the template-strings (or f-strings). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide readability, causes inconsistency instead. Until now, I used string-quotes for the variable definitions and double-quotes for the visible texts.</description>

      <title>Spreadsheet applications</title>
      <link>https://gokmengorgen.net/en/blog/spreasheet-apps/</link>

      <description>Spreadsheet applications are the most functional applications I&amp;rsquo;ve used. Excel, Gnumeric, Google Sheet, OpenOffice Calc or whatever, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. You can use it as task management like Trello, make daily - weekly - monthly plans, store and transfer data, and follow your financial situation. It&amp;rsquo;s like a Swiss army knife and not a new invention.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update this article when I find a more functional application.</description>

      <title>How do I publish my articles?</title>
      <link>https://gokmengorgen.net/en/blog/how-do-i-publish-my-articles/</link>

      <guid>https://gokmengorgen.net/en/blog/how-do-i-publish-my-articles/</guid>
      <description>With just a command:
# terminal $ ENV=PROD ./do.sh deploy  I have many projects using my script named DOSH and the parameters are mostly in common; deploy, start, stop, runtests, etc. It can be a .NET Core or a Django project, or just a website using any static site generator like this one but I run all the projects with the same command: dosh start.
In Windows, the command may be a bit longer than in the other operating systems.</description>

      <description>PowerShell and Git encoding problems To make git log command output properly display on Windows, we need to set a variable named LC_ALL:
LC_ALL=&amp;quot;C.UTF-8&amp;quot;  Incorrect home folder in Emacs This problem is not only about Emacs. If you try to find a file from HOME variable, you may need to define the variable first:
HOME=&amp;quot;%USERPROFILE%&amp;quot;  ;; place all backup files in one directory (setq backup-directory-alist `((&amp;quot;.*&amp;quot; . ,temporary-file-directory))) (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((&amp;quot;.</description>
