      <description>At the end of my three-week vacation, I was asked for a seemingly easy task. We were going to release the new version of the project we developed:
 Is today is the last working of the week? No. Is there any problem with the unit tests? No. Are all changes confirmed by the product manager, in the staging server? Yes.  I always note everything, and so I write this article to remind this experience.</description>

      <description>With just a command:
# terminal $ ENV=PROD ./do.sh deploy  I have many projects using my script named DOSH and the parameters are mostly in common; deploy, start, stop, runtests, etc. It can be a .NET Core or a Django project, or just a website using any static site generator like this one but I run all the projects with the same command: dosh start.
In Windows, the command may be a bit longer than in the other operating systems.</description>
