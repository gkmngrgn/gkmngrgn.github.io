      <description>I started to take a look at C++ courses to understand Rust better because it helps me to see the advantages of Rust. The following images are from a Linkedin course, the instructor is Bill Weinman, and his courses are perfect if you want to program with C++.
If you have a photographic memory to remind something quickly, then you may like these images explaining data types in programming.</description>

      <title>String quotes in PEP8</title>

      <description>I use PEP8 in my Python projects except for a few rules.
I think &amp;lsquo;single-quote&amp;rsquo; and &amp;ldquo;double-quote&amp;rdquo; characters should NOT be the same. It could be better if these two characters had different counterparts in the Python language parser system. So we could use one of them for the template-strings (or f-strings). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide readability, causes inconsistency instead. Until now, I used string-quotes for the variable definitions and double-quotes for the visible texts.</description>
