      <description>I had trouble understanding the story of the game because I didn&amp;rsquo;t play the first one. You start to play the game in the middle of the adventure. You have a sword and shield, so you think that the story is in the past, but you also have a kind of motorcycle that has no wheels but can fly. Also, you have a brother in arms named Gen, and it&amp;rsquo;s a robot.</description>

      <description>I have a gaming PC for two years but couldn&amp;rsquo;t have time to play a game. So I decided to change my priorities in my life and will try to play more games and read more books this year.
My first plan was to play this game with my daughter, but I realized that it was not a suitable game for kids after I bought it, so I&amp;rsquo;ll pay attention to use the family filter from now on.</description>
